                    Welcome to 'Y', the question hidden in plain sight. Here we gather the latest news that some people dismiss
                    as fake news or conspiracy. We believe that the truth is out there, and we are here to find it and bring it to you. Here 
                    you will find the latest news, the most recent discoveries, and the most controversial topics. You can join
                    us and 'do your own research'. Together we can find the truth.
